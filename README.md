# JAlox (Just Another LOX)
My Implementation of the LOX Programming Language

## What is LOX ? 
LOX is full-featured, efficient scripting language implemented  By Robert Nystrom in his book [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) .
He used JAVA for the main Language frontend ( things like parser ,lexer etc.) and C  the programming language for the interpreter.
But I will be using  Python and the C programming Language . It is going to be a long one so enjoy :) .
